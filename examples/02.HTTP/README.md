HTTP Example
============

This example shows simple use of the TCP socket API.
It establishes a connection to example.com on port 80 and fetches the page shown there.
Note that this is *not* intended as an example of how to handle HTTP.
It does some very simple HTTP header parsing to find the content length, but is in no way robust.
